pa1.sh is desired script in assignment 

create_test_env.sh is a helper script that creates test env as:
1-)golden.txt in same location with pa1.sh
2-)Creates a submissions folder if not already exist
3-)Creates 4 test bash scripts as required in assignment

Usage of script as wanted in assignment, nothing extra special about usage.
It can work any files accoring to scope in assignment, but in the test env I created all lines as integer

Usage of create_test_env:
$chmod +x create_test_env.sh (if not already executable)
$./create_test_env
